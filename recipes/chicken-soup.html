    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the following, adding each to the same large bowl as you complete it:
            Dice 1 large onion (about 2 cups). Peel and cut 3 medium carrots crosswise into
             1/2-inch thick rounds (about 1 3/4 cups). Cut 3 medium celery stalks crosswise
              into 1/2-inch thick pieces (about 1 1/4 cups). Mince 3 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons unsalted butter or heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a Dutch
             oven heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the onion mixture, 2 1/2 teaspoons
              kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the
               onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 2 (32-ounce) cartons low-sodium chicken broth, 5 sprigs fresh thyme, and 2 dried
             bay leaves. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, use 2
              forks to shred the meat from 1 (2 1/2- to 3-pound) rotisserie chicken or 1 pound 
              cooked, boneless chicken into bite-sized pieces (about 3 cups).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and 6 ounces dried extra-wide egg noodles to the soup. Reduce the
             heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the noodles are just shy of al dente,
              6 to 7 minutes or 1 minute less than the package instructions. Meanwhile, finely chop
               the leaves and tender stems from 1/2 medium bunch fresh parsley or dill until you have 1/4 cup.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard the thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed.
             Add the chopped parsley or dill. If using, squeeze the juice from 1/2 large lemon until you have 2 
             tablespoons. Add to soup and stir to combine.</li>
    </ol>
